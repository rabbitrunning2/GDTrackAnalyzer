===============
This is a pet project to create statistics for a plist .xml file.
The project was created to parse data 
from my extensive Grateful Dead collection in iTunes.

I wanted to know the average ratings of each song by title.
I wanted to know which year I rated the highest.
etc & etc & etc

I copied my playlist into an xml file and included it to parse.
This is the first stage in a more robust xml searching tool for iTunes.

The xml file can be substituted for any playlist xml file.
Eventually I will put in an option to browse and include User defined file.

It currently does not search by Artist as this was initially designed to 
be a tool for the Dead. This will be a future TODO.
